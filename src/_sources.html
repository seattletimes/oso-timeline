  This graphic relied on reports, memos, correspondence and photos obtained from local, state and federal agencies, including:
<ul>
  <li> State: The Department of Natural Resources; Department of Ecology; Game and Fisheries departments (both since folded into the Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife); the Recreation and Conservation Office; Department of Transportation; and the University of Washington;
  <li> Federal: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the U.S. Forest Service; the U.S. Geological Survey; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture;
  <li> Local: Snohomish County departments including Public Works; Emergency Management; Planning; Health; and the Assessor’s office.
</ul>
<p>
  Most of these records were obtained under the state’s Public Records Act or the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, or from the Washington State Archives.

  Some reporting relied on mapping and geographical analysis; among other steps we cross-referenced aerial photos and utilized lidar imagery, which exposes landscape beneath vegetation. In three instances – 1947, 1955 and 1969 – we needed to combine two aerial images taken on the same day, which is why there’s a visible line or divider toward the top of the photos.

  We researched newspaper archives and tapped books, videos and oral or written histories from people who studied the hill or lived in or visited this river valley. We also drew on news accounts from The Seattle Times, The (Everett) Herald and NBC News.
