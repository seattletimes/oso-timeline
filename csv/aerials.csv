1933,"In the early 20th century the North Fork of the Stillaguamish kept to the hill's south. But high water began pushing the channel north, toward the hill, in the early 1930s. Here, the river is starting to undercut the hill's toe. The river also has taken on a horseshoe shape, with bends that create more energy &mdash; as water hits the bank  &mdash; than a gradual curve would generate.",University of Washington
1947,"In the 1940s the active landslide zone is estimated to be 10 acres. Note how the river has pushed farther north &mdash; and how the channel has changed from a horseshoe bend into a single, tight turn of more than 90 degrees, concentrating the river's force as it hits the hill.",Daniel J. Miller
1955,"In the early 1950s a mudslide partially dammed the river. The active slide area extended as much as 1,000 feet back from the river, with a scarp &mdash; a steep, exposed cut &mdash; as high as 70 feet. By 1955, the active slide area has expanded from 10 to 13 acres.  The lower slide has lost its vegetative cover. ""More importantly, a scarp has formed high up the slope covered with conifer trees indicating large-scale instability,"" a geological study noted.",Snohomish County
1965,"The slide has ""greatly increased its activity,"" expanding from 13 to 21 acres. Check out the white lines south of the river, mirroring the channel's shape. Those are new roads for Steelhead Haven, an 82-lot development approved by Snohomish County in 1960. Thirty-two lots sold in the first 15 months, to be used for summer cabins.",Washington Department of Natural Resources
1969,"A major landslide in 1967 ""dramatically altered the geometry"" of the river and hill, with nearly 40 acres falling away. The slide pushed the river 700 to 800 feet south, into the neighborhood of Steelhead Haven. Forty-eight of 82 lots flooded out. A 1969 county memo described the neighborhood as ""presently vacant with a few scattered vacation cabins"" and one or two mobile homes. A year after this photo was taken, the active slide area was 35 acres, up from 21 in 1965.",Snohomish County
1978,"The 1967 slide left a field of debris between the river and hill, temporarily protecting the hill's toe from further erosion. In the 1970s the river began chewing through that unsettled material, creeping back toward the hill. From 1970 to 1978, the river moved 400 feet north, according to a state report. At the same time, building resumed, with new homes going into the Steelhead Haven neighborhood.",Daniel J. Miller
1984,"From 1978 to 1984, the river marched another 200 feet north, increasing the threat that it would erode the hill's toe. While much of the slide area has been re-vegetated, the river has just about reestablished the position it had before the 1967 landslide.",Daniel J. Miller
1989,"In 1988, on Thanksgiving, a small slide pushed debris into the channel. This slide occurred within the scar of the much larger 1967 slide, but moved only one or two acres of that all that unsettled material. ""[T]hus much more is available as a supply for future events,"" a state soils specialist wrote. The white, sparsely vegetated areas &mdash; northwest of the river, with pockets farther north &mdash; suggest where the slide is most active.",U.S. Geological Survey
1998,"The river holds its position, at the base of the hill. In the years since the 1967 slide, 16 new homes have been built across the river. A year after this photo was taken, Dan Miller, a geomorphologist, wrote a report for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warning of the slide's ""potential for a large catastrophic failure.""",Snohomish County
2005,"Northwest of the river there is less vegetation, suggesting slide activity. The state and the Stillaguamish Tribe have made plans to build a long wall of logs between the hill and river, to guard against erosion and keep sediment from hurting fish habitat. But before they can do that...",U.S. Department of Agriculture
2006,"In January 2006, a slice of hill about 900 feet across collapsed, sending several hundred thousand cubic yards of mud, clay and trees into the river. The slide pushed the channel 730 feet south, causing flooding that threatened homes in Steelhead Haven. Emergency work by county and federal workers saved the neighborhood, with just one homeowner losing an outhouse and tool shed.",U.S. Department of Agriculture
2011,"After the 2006 slide the state spent $1 million on a log barrier &mdash; 15 feet high, 1,500 feet long &mdash; that separated the river and hill. The barrier, called a crib wall, required repeated repairs.",U.S. Department of Agriculture
2014,"On March 22, 2014, the hill fell away, with millions of cubic yards of mud and trees crashing across the river, through Steelhead Haven, and onto Highway 530. More than 30 homes were destroyed. Forty-three people were killed. ",Washington Department of Transportation
